Example: the dominant aqueous species for dissolved nitrogen is NO3 and commonly concentrations for Nitrate in water are therefore expressed as NO3 mg/L. Sometimes Nitrate is also expressed as N mg/L. 50 mg of Nitrate espressed as NO3 correspond to 11.2 mg/L Nitrate as N. When comparing nitrate concentrations from different laboratories or to a guideline value, it is important to verify, if all values are expressed as the same species and if not, are converted using the tool below.",
