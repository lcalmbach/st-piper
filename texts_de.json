It offers most of the numeric and graphics features required for the interpretation of hydrochemical data. You may explore one of the preconfigured datasets to familiarize yourself with the software.\n\nIf you want to upload your own dataset, you must have an account and be logged in.

Example: the dominant aqueous species for dissolved nitrogen is NO3 and commonly concentrations for Nitrate in water are therefore expressed as NO3 mg/L. Sometimes Nitrate is also expressed as N mg/L. 50 mg of Nitrate espressed as NO3 correspond to 11.2 mg/L Nitrate as N. When comparing nitrate concentrations from different laboratories or to a guideline value, it is important to verify, if all values are expressed as the same species and if not, are converted using the tool below.",
