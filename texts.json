At the beginning a sample dataset is loaded, demonstrating the possiblities of  the program without further formatting. If you want to analyse your own data, the *data* option needs to be selected. In this menu option, your data can be uploaded, columns mapped to internal parameters in order to use plots with specific parameters such as the Piper plot.",

Also coordinates (lat/long in decimal degrees) are mandatory, if maps should be created. Additional non mandatory parmeters may include: station-type, geology, nearest location, landuse etc. Use the *Show only matched parameters* checkbox option to limit the list of parameters to the ones that have been mapped.",

Other sample parameters may include a unique sample code, sampling personel information, comments related to the sampling event etc. If a dataset includes only one sample per station and no field related to the sampling event, check the *no columns related to the sample* checkbox.

The metadata includes information required for certain analyses, for example the piper diagram needs know which parameters correspond to the main cations and anions and converts the concentration typically given in mg/L to meq/L%. Fontus assumes that every expression appearin in the parameter column is a parameter, however in order to use features such as conversion to mmmol/L or meq/L, these parameters must be matched to the Fontus internal parameters.",
