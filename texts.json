In order to familiarize yourself with the software, two preconfigured datasets can also be used. If you intend to explore your own dataset, use the *Select or load dataset* option. In this menu option, your data can be uploaded, columns mapped to internal parameters in order to use plots with specific parameter settings, such as the Piper plot.",
